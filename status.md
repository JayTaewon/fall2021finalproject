Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have written the code to send a message from Python to my roommates. I have also started creating the button input and figuring out how to translate this over to the Raspberry Pi.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet combined the button input with my python code and need to figure out how to do so.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

A massive problem, I couldn't find a way to send an SMS message from the Pi without needing to buy a phone number or some other sms service. So instead, I decided to have the message send through discord instead, since all my roommates use it frequently.
