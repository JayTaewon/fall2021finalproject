# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Emergency Meeting! Press the button.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A button connected to a raspberry pi that when pressed will send a notification to my roommates.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In terms of hardware, my project will require a Raspberry Pi, a button to connect to the Pi via a breadboard, and then a phone (ideally multiple phones) to recieve the message. Put simply, the button will be pressed triggering code in the Raspberry Pi. The software I make will take this input to send a custom message to the phone recipients, as well as a sound to accompany it. This button is based around the Emergency Meeting button from Among Us, so it's primary function would be to get the attention of all my roommates simultaneously to address an issue of some sort.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Pressing the button sends a single message to my roommates' phones.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Pressing the button sends a customizable message to my roommates' phones.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Pressing the button sends a customizable message to my roommates' phones, as well as playing a unique notification sound.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The main things I will have to learn for this project is how to use the Raspberry Pi alongside a breadboard. I've never used a breadboard before so I need to figure out wiring as well as how it works with python on the Raspberry Pi. I'll also need to research more basics of the Raspberry Pi since I've never really done a complete project on one before, so there are some basics that need to be learned. I'm going to have to research how to send messages to cell phones from the pi as well.
