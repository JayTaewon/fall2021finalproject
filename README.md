I found this project to be really fun. It started out as a project that I thought would be pretty decent, but surprise surprise, it was way harder than expected.

My original plan was to make a button that when pressed would send a text message to my roommates and a custom sound. It only took a few minutes of research to realize I didn't have the resources for something like this. The first obstacle I encountered was the fact that I would need to have another SMS phone number. This was not achievable within the given time span, so I swapped SMS with a discord message instead. 
The next issue I had was figuring out how to connect a button to my Raspberry Pi. While I owned a RasPi for a long time, I've never really learned how to use or code on it, so this was a big learning curve. I found out the capabilities of adding a breadboard to my project which made wiring the button a LOT easier. This was a fun thing to learn, as it was an interesting sample of electrical engineering and problem solving.
Once I had that sorted out, I had to figure out how to send discord messages from Python. This took me a long time to figure out, but many YouTube videos and articles later, I was able to put together a code that worked nicely.
My final obstacle came with adding a custom sound. I had already spent too much time working on the button itself, so I ran out of time to find any way to change the notification sound. So at this point, I dropped this from my list.

Overall, I found that this project tested me way more than anticipated, but I am pretty proud with the result I came out with. I learned a good amount and was able to apply my new Python knowledge to those things as well.
